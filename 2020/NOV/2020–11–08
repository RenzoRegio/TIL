Currently working on: Airbnb Clone Project - Using Python, Django, Tailwind, HTML and CSS

Today I learned about seeding:
First we have to create our own command in Django. To do so, it is quite simple. In any of our applications, we must create a folder. 
In my case, I created a folder called "management". In the management folder, we must create an __init__.py so Django knows that this is a Python folder 
and that Django will understand what we are trying to do. Next, inside the management folder I created a folder called "commands" - and in the commands folder 
I also made another __init__.py file and made another .py file called seed_amenities where I will execute my command for seeding my amenities list. 

First we need to import BaseCommand from the Django's core.management.base. 
So that our command can be executed, we need to create a class that inherits the properties of BaseCommad. You can also add an argument 
here but in this case we don't need it right now. 
For every command that we make, we need to create a handle. The handle should always have the arguments self, *args and **options.
After we create the handle, this is where we can put in the code that we want to execute. In my case, I need to create an amenities list 
for my Django Amenities Admin. But before anything else, I had to import my Amenity model from my rooms application. 
Now I need to connect each amenity in the list to the name field in my Amenity class. To do this we have to use the for loop.
Note: self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("Amenities Created")) will show up in your terminal if the command was executed. 
self.style.success will indicate the style/color of the string you put in the parentheses. self.style.SUCCESS shows green and 
self.style.ERROR shows red.

Let's execute our command in the terminal. We will use our seed_amenities.py as the command:
It works!
Now we have 42 amenities without the need of individually adding them in our Amenity Admin.
