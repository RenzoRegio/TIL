Today I learned how Django can really make someone’s life so much easier. In my previous TIL, I talked about how I made a sign in form. And there were some repetitive coding because I would need to manually do it for each field/input. Since I have first_name, last_name, email, password, and confirm_password fields I really had to do it repetitively if I wanted to use hardcore 100% Python code.

100% Python Log In Form
Note: I used FormView for my login and signup forms.

But there is actually a much more easier way. And it is through using Django’s “looping over the form fields”. Basically, we just have to create a for loop in the html file and just place the proper variables. By using this it simplifies the code and lessens the time you spend on it.
If you look at the code below it says for field in form. Why field? because in our forms.py, our first_name, last_name, password, etc are all fields. and why form? it is because what we created is from a FormView. Also, these are the variables that Django will look for if you make use of this method. The code below does exactly the same functions as the 100% Python code. And it is that simple.

Though, sometimes I do prefer doing 100% Python code more because it shows me the detail of how everything works and functions from the backend.
