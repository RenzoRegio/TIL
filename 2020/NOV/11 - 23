Today I learned about OAuth. OAuth is basically how someone from a third-party website (like my current airbnb clone project) can access data from a different website like Github, KakaoTalk, Facebook and more without the need of retrieving the password. This is usually what we see on websites like “Login with Facebook” or “Login with Gmail” and similar things.
At first, it was quite complicated. I thought it was difficult because of the amount of code I had to put in. But eventually, I thought of it as something quite simple.
This is a part of my code where I am going to try to connect with Github and KakaoTalk:

Similarly to other path’s we also have to create a url path and a def for the two.
First, Github:

We always have to register our application — to whichever website it may be. And we will receive the client ID and client secret that will be used in the process.

It is quite simple and the documentation (Based on what I’ve seen on KakaTalk and Github) explained thoroughly on how to do it step by step.
This is how I was able to do it. In the process itself, I had to create a user after being able to access the information such as username, email, bio, first_name, etc. from Github. Following the step by step process on the documentation is definitely useful!
