Currently working on: Airbnb Clone Project - Using Python, Django, Tailwind, HTML and CSS
Classes: Collapse
Instead of having endless fieldsets containing dozens of information on one of your admin panels on Django (like the image below), 
you can make use of classes: ("collapse",)

In Django, one of the classes that are defined by the Django default site stylesheet is "collapse". The function of collapse is to allow the 
user/admin to show or hide the fieldset. After using "classes":("collapse",), instead of endlessly scrolling trying to find the fieldset 
or field that you want to go to, you can now hide/show the fieldsets that have too many fields or is just taking a lot of space.

Sample code of how I used collapse:

search_fields:
Search_fields is a very useful tool when trying to search for a specific field on your admin panel. If there is an incredible amount of fields 
you have to go through, having search_fields on your admin.py is very useful. It allows you to have a search bar on the very top - right above all 
your fieldsets.

Having search_fields allows you to basically filter what you search. You can use prefixes such as ^ or = to filter what you search. For example:

![1_LGGVm-uFPaLZNUx7QUdnzQ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72249533/98446075-3977f900-2156-11eb-83e8-68d71592beab.png)

City, host__username, and country are fields. By placing these fields inside the search_fields function, it allows you to only search 
for what is inside (regardless if you have other fields such as name, room_type, etc.). By default, search_fields is using none as a prefix. 
So, if you only put "city", "host__username" and "country", it will search everything with the same letters.

For example, We are trying to search for London using search_fields and our code is:

![1_KUmfhKa60av9gmr4CMkAKA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72249533/98446105-57ddf480-2156-11eb-9e38-b52d31435d99.png)

Since the default prefix is none, search_fields will automatically search for all cities that have the letters "on".
And this should not be the case. What should only show up would be the cities that start with "on".

This is where we will make use of the prefixes. Using ^ means starts with. So I will change my code by using the prefix ^. Using this will
basically filter your search with only the starting letters of the field.

Now, if I search for "on", London won't show up anymore since we are using the prefix ^ starts with.

But if we search for "Lon" which are the starting letters for London. We will have a result because of the prefix ^

Using prefixes and search_fields are very useful when you're searching for something specific. You can also make use of the prefix = which 
means exact. You will search exactly what you're looking for. So if we change our code to:

Even if we search for "Lon", London won't appear anymore since we are trying to search for exactly "London" because of the = prefix.
